## Description ##

The Social Count Plus performs counting for:

- Comments total
- Facebook page fans
- GitHub followers
- Google+ page/profile followers
- Instagram followers
- LinkedIn company followers
- Pinterest followers
- Posts total
- SoundCloud followers
- Steam Community group members
- Tumblr followers
- Twitch channel followers
- Twitter followers
- Users total
- Vimeo followers

You can display your numbers using a Widget (with links and icons) or Shortcodes (to be used in posts and pages) or PHP functions in your theme.

The results of the counters are cached and new values ​​are checked only once a day. This cache can be wiped when published a new post.

The cache avoids not only that your blog be seeking new results every time a page is loaded, but also prevents collapse of services from Twitter and Facebook, if one of these services does not respond, the counter displays the last count it was successful.
